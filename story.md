## Inspiration
Not a lot of people use Linux as their main operating system. This is a problem because Microsoft ended support for Windows 10 recently, and an estimated 240 million computers will become obselete because of this. Most, if not all of these computers could run Linux, but people are afraid to switch. This app is designed to help people make the switch.

## What it does
Linux Conversion Expert helps people switch to Linux. It asks a few questions and then uses AI to suggest a few distros that would good for the user. In the future, it will also help people find software for Linux and assist with the installation.

## How I built it
Linux Conversion Expert was coded in C# (.NET), the UI was designed with Avalonia, and OpenRouter provided the AI integration.

## Challenges I ran into
It was a challenge integration AI into the project, I haven't tried this before.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am proud of building a useful app in such little time.

## What I learned
I learned how to make an application integrated with AI.

## What's next for Linux Conversion Expert
I am planning to make the app be able to:
- Help people find software to use
- Find support resources
- Assist with installation
